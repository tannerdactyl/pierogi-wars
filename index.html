			<h2>Truck vs. City</h2>
			<p>When food trucks line up on city streets, it may look like a competitive atmosphere. However, food truck owners will tell you that trucks depend on one another to attract customers.</p>

		<h3>Jumping through Hoops</h3>
		<p>It was an outdoor space that first inspired Damian Warzecha to open a food truck. He worked in a restaurant with a patio in Chicago and found he loved the atmosphere.</p>
		<p>"It's a festival-like kind of environment," Warzecha said. "I always enjoyed that."</p>
		<p> He took this inspiration and opened Pierogi Wagon, a bright orange and blue truck that rolls through the city's streets dishing out a Polish delicacy.</p>
		<p>Pierogi Wagon serves only pierogi, a traditional Polish dish of fried dumplings stuffed with a variety of ingredients. Warzecha, who was born and raised in Poland, operates the food truck with the help of his girlfriend and daughter.</p>
		<p>Following through on his idea was initially harder than Warzecha expected. While the upkeep and operation of the food truck were straightforward, Damian didn't anticipate the upfront cost of the truck. If he were opening a traditional restaurant, the lease would give him the opportunity to generate profit before having to pay. With the food truck, he had to pay up front for the truck, he said. This didn't stop him, though. Instead, he took to Kickstarter to crowdfund the truck, raising more than $600 beyond his $15,000 goal.</p>
		<p>With regulations, licenses, inspections and fees, food trucks find themselves jumping through hoops to be able to operate in Chicago.</p>

				<div class="pull-quote">Perhaps the toughest conflict between the city and food trucks is the set of rules trucks must abide by once they are in business.</div>
			</div>
		<p>To apply for a mobile food vendor license, an individual must first submit a license application to the Business Affairs & Consumer Protection office with the city of Chicago. The BACP application includes information about the applicant, a government-issued Employer Identification Number and a State of Illinois File Number. Both numbers are retrieved through separate application processes. Food truck owners also must obtain a retail food establishment license, as well as a Food Sanitation Manager Certificate issued by the city. Lastly, to apply, the individual needs commercial general liability insurance. They then have to pay application and license fees between $700-$1,000 that stand for two years.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the toughest conflict between the city and food trucks, though, is the set of rules trucks must abide by once they are in business. Like any restaurant, food trucks are subject to health and fire safety inspections. But food trucks have a special operational requirement unique to their type of business â€“ they must have a permanently installed GPS device activated whenever the food truck is in business.</p>
		<p>Unlike restaurants, they can only operate between 5 a.m. and 2 a.m. within the city of Chicago.</p>
		<p>"The three main things that are challenging are the 200-foot rule, the two hour limit rule and the amount of propane we're allowed on our truck, which is 40 pounds," said Sarah Weitz, owner of the Fat Shallot food truck.</p>
		<p>The propane limit means that every two lunch periods Weitz caters to, she has to replace the propane in her truck. For larger events such as the Taste of Chicago that last all day, she has to refill midday. Other major cities have food truck propane limits between 100-200 pounds, but the propane limit for food trucks in Chicago is equal to what a person can have in his or her backyard, she said.</p>

		<h3>Clashing with Competition</h3>
		<p>The nature of competition with brick and mortar restaurants, however, is more complicated. Warzecha sometimes operates near restaurants that are competing for his business.</p>
		<p>"It's legal parking for us, so we park there, but I know the restaurant owner is not happy with food trucks being next to him because he's empty and we're having lines," Warzecha said. :It's all because of what we serve and what he serves."</p>
		<p>There are laws that seek to level the playing field. Food trucks may not stop within 200 feet of a restaurant.</p>

			</div>
		<p>Warzecha said he competes with brick and mortar restaurants for customers, including another business that specializes in pierogi, Pierogi Heaven.</p>
		<p>The original Pierogi Heaven is situated in the Loop, with a second location just a few blocks from the first. Located on N. Wells St. in Chicago, the restaurant aims to serve up the best of traditional Polish dishes.</p>
		<p>The restaurant is open six days a week until 7 p.m., and caters mainly to a business crowd, said PERSON X. The Pierogi Heaven staff sees its biggest rush at lunch, much like Pierogi Wagon.</p>
		<p>The clash between restaurants and food trucks is a daily reality for many truck owners, who have to be sure to abide strictly by the rules to avoid restaurant owners wary of losing business.</p>
		<p>"They'll call and complain to the city, their aldermen. Some come up and talk to us personally, which we prefer," Weitz said. "They'll tell us, 'Hey, you've been here for more than two hours,' and sometimes they will call the police."</p>
		<p>She noted restaurants directly contact her most frequently to complain about her food truck.</p>

		<h3>Benefits of Competition</h3>
		<p>While Weitz says the competition between restaurants and food trucks and between food trucks themselves is "a constant," Warzecha said he's doesn't worry about it too much.</p>
		<p>"It's an open market," he said. "If you have good food, people are going to come to you."</p>
		<p>The key advantage to a food truck is mobility, Warzecha said. Unlike a restaurant, which lives and dies by its location, a food truck can move if a parking spot stops being profitable</p>
		<p>"How do I choose the location? Money." Warzecha said. "We go to places where there's money, where's there's people, where we are expected."</p>
		<p>Warzecha considers parking spots with other food trucks nearby as a good environment for business, even if the trucks sometimes compete for customers.</p> 
		<p>"The more food trucks in one spot, the more people come to the trucks," he said. "It becomes a magnet. If people see many choices, it's easier for them to stop by."</p>

			</div>
		<p>Weitz also said that while there is competition between food trucks, the conflict only betters the market for the trucks.</p>
		<p>"I do think trucks do better if there's more of us there," she said.</p>
		<p>The Fat Shallot usually parks in areas with other food trucks, which she said can be good for business.</p>
		<p>"If you go to a place where no one has ever seen a food truck before, you're going to sell five portions," Warzecha said. "It takes time to develop a location. It takes time to train the market. You have to have people understand that you are coming here on a regular basis, and that's how you build the lines. That's how you get regular customers."</p>
